To approach this riddle, let’s break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:** \n   - Let \\( b \\) be the number of brothers.\n   - Let \\( g \\) be the number of sisters.\n\n2. **Understanding the Riddle:**\n   - According to the riddle, the girl has as many brothers as sisters, which can be written as:\n     \\[\n     b = g - 1\n     \\]\n     (since the girl herself is not counted among her sisters).\n   - Each brother has half as many brothers as sisters, which can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     b - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} g\n     \\]\n     (since each brother doesn’t count himself).\n\n3. **Set Up the Equations:**\n   Now we have two equations:\n   1. \\( b = g - 1 \\)\n   2. \\( b - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} g \\)\n\n4. **Substitute and Solve:**\n   - Substitute the expression for \\( b \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n     \\[\n     (g - 1) - 1 = \\frac{1}{2} g\n     \\]\n     Simplifying gives:\n     \\[\n     g - 2 = \\frac{1}{2} g\n     \\]\n   - Now, rearrange:\n     \\[\n     g - \\frac{1}{2} g = 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{1}{2} g = 2\n     \\]\n   - Multiply by 2:\n     \\[\n     g = 4\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find the Number of Brothers:**\n   Substitute \\( g \\) back into the first equation:\n   \\[\n   b = g - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   So, there are **3 brothers and 4 sisters** in the family.\n\n### Reflection Prompts:\n- **Understanding:** How do you feel about the way we tackled this riddle? \n- **Connection:** Can you think of how the problem-solving skills you used here could apply to another subject or area of life?\n- **Challenges:** Was there anything in the solving process that you found particularly challenging? How might you approach it differently next time?\n\nLet me know your thoughts!",

We’ll focus on promoting your independent problem-solving skills.\n\nTo help you think through the riddle on your own, here are some guiding questions:\n\n1. **Identify Relationships:** What do you think the riddle is asking about the relationships between brothers and sisters? How can we represent those relationships mathematically?\n\n2. **Create Equations:** Can you write an equation for the statement about how many brothers the girl has compared to how many sisters she has? What about the brothers' perspective?\n\n3. **Substituting Variables:** If you let \\( b \\) equal the number of brothers and \\( g \\) equal the number of sisters, how could you express the riddle’s conditions in terms of these two variables?\n\n4. **Solve the Equations:** Once you have your equations, what steps would you take to isolate one variable and eventually solve for the number of brothers and sisters? \n\n5. **Reflect on Your Process:** After attempting to solve the equations, what did you find easy or difficult about the process? What strategies helped you?\n\nFeel free to give your answers to these questions one by one, and I’ll provide feedback and guidance based on your input. This way, we can work through the riddle together!",
